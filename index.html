  <p id= "intro">
    In society, it has become normalized that clothes are either  “female” or  “male,” however, clothes have no gender. No matter how someone dresses or looks, we should be respectful of their preferred pronouns and ask instead of assuming.

<p id="issues"> This mindset of clothes being either "feminine" or "masculine" has been around for a long time. For most people, this doesn't bother them. However, for genderqueer or transgender people, this mindset can be super harmful. For example, say that someone identifies as non-binary. With a fixed mindset that declares clothes as only female or male, the person might feel out of place and judged. With a simple realization that clothes don't make people a certain gender, we can change society's views and make the world more inclusive towards all genders, not just male and female. </p>

  <h2 id="mentalHealth"> The Harmful Effects of This Mindset</h2>

  <p id="healthParagraph"> What many people don't realize is that pronouns and different genders are more than personal preference; people use their pronouns and gender to show their identity. They can't change how they feel about their body and mind. Actually, in recent studies, scientists have found that a transgender person's brain resembles that person's preferred gender. You can read more about this at https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/. Not only does mis-gendering and dead-naming people decrease self-confidence, it can also lead to mental health problems. Transgender and genderqueer people usually have something known as "gender dysphoria," or a sense of unease between someone's biological sex and their gender identity. Through dead-naming and refusing to respect pronouns, many people with gender dysphoria can develop issues like depression, anxiety, and in some cases, eating disorders. Knowing this, we should try our best to respect people's identities and stop any bullying towards people who don't fit the gender binary.</p>
